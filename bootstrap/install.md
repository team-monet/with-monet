# Monet — agent-first install playbook

**You are the user's coding agent.** The user pasted a one-line request to set up Monet. Your job is to install and configure it *for* them — running the commands yourself, conversing at each decision point, and diagnosing/fixing failures as you go. **Do not ask the user to clone a repo or run shell scripts themselves.** Adapt to their host and preferences.

Work through the phases in order. After each, tell the user what happened in one line. If a step fails, show the error, explain the likely cause, propose a fix, and retry — never leave a half-configured state.

**This playbook is self-contained — no clone or pre-install needed.** You install the substrate yourself (Phase 2), and you read any prompt file you need (`roster.json`, `agents/<name>.md`) from one of:
- a local `with-monet` checkout if one exists (prefer it), else
- this repo's raw URLs, base `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/team-monet/with-monet/main/` (e.g. `…/agents/stig.md`).

(Raw fetch needs the repo to be **public**; if it's private and you can't fetch, that's the one time to ask the user to clone `with-monet` and point you at the local path.)

## Updating an existing install (team files only)

Already set up and just want the latest team (Stig + workers)? You don't need to re-run onboarding — re-run **Phase 4 only** against the latest sources:
1. Re-read `roster.json`, `agents/*.md`, and `agents/stig.md` from the raw-URL base (or your local `with-monet` checkout).
2. Re-apply Phase 4's write step **to the same scope the team was installed in** — detect that from where the existing `<!-- BEGIN with-monet:stig -->` / `<!-- with-monet:agent -->` markers already live — in your host's lead-persona file and its worker/subagent locations (the surfaces you found in Phase 1), at whichever scope (user or repo) they were installed. Rewrite the Stig block (between the `<!-- BEGIN with-monet:stig -->` / `<!-- END with-monet:stig -->` markers) and each agent file **in that location** — never silently switch a per-repo install to global. **Reconcile, don't clobber:** preserve your local edits, apply the new changes, guard the invariants, and keep `.bak` (see Phase 4).

Skip Phases 1–3 (substrate + MCP already configured) and 5–7 — except: if your host loads agents/MCP only at startup (most do — you noted this in Phase 1), **reload or restart it afterward** so the updated Stig + workers take effect; a running session keeps the old prompts until you do. Phase 4 is idempotent, so this is safe to repeat.

---

## Phase 1 — Orient

You install Monet **globally for this user** (every project), not just the current repo — so the team and memory work everywhere without re-installing per project. (If the user prefers, you can scope it to just this repo instead — confirm in step 2.)

1. **Identify your host and its install surfaces.** You're the agent running inside it, so you know — or its docs do — where it keeps, at user scope, (a) its **MCP server config**, (b) its **always-on lead-persona / system prompt**, and (c) its **named-subagent definitions** (if it has them). Note two capabilities that gate the rest of the install:
   - **MCP support — required.** Monet is an MCP server and Stig's whole loop is MCP tools (`agent_context`, `memory_store`, `memory_checkpoint`). If the host can't run MCP servers, **stop** and tell the user Monet needs an MCP-capable host.
   - **Real isolated subagents — needed for the worker team.** Each worker must run in its *own fresh context* the lead can delegate into — not an always-on "rule" that bleeds into the main context. If the host has this, you'll install the full team (Phase 4 Tier B); if not, you'll install Stig solo. **Feature-detect it from the host's docs — don't infer it from the host's name** (host capabilities change fast).

   Also note whether the host loads MCP/agents only at startup (you'll tell the user to reload afterward). Anything unclear — check the host's docs or ask the user; don't guess.
2. Confirm: *"You're on **<host>**. I'll install Monet **globally** so it works across all your projects — or scoped to just this repo if you'd rather. Anything special about your setup?"*

## Phase 2 — Get Monet

Goal: the `monet` MCP server (the state-centric memory substrate) available on this machine.

- Install from npm (published):
  ```
  npm i -g @team-monet/monet      # provides the `monet` command
  ```
  Zero-install alternative: `npx -y @team-monet/monet start`. Requires `node` ≥ 22 and network access — the first run downloads the MiniLM embedding model once.
- Dev / unpublished fallback: clone `team-monet/monet`, then `pnpm install && pnpm build`, and use `node <abs>/dist/index.js`.

## Phase 3 — Configure the monet MCP server (user scope)

Register `monet` in your host's MCP config at **user scope** so it's available in every project (template: `with-monet/mcp/monet.json`). The entry to merge is:
```jsonc
{ "mcpServers": { "monet": { "command": "monet", "args": ["start"] } } }
```
*(Dev/unpublished fallback: use `"command": "node", "args": ["<abs>/dist/index.js"]` in place of `"command": "monet"`.)*

Merge that entry into your host's user-level MCP config in whatever form the host expects — a CLI command, a JSON config file, or a settings UI — **without clobbering** existing servers. You know your host's MCP setup, or its docs do; if you're unsure, ask the user. (A host with no MCP support → you already stopped at Phase 1.)

**Storage — one global brain, organized per project.** By default the store lives at `~/.monet` (shared across all the user's projects) and Monet organizes each project into its own *circle* automatically — no config required. If the user prefers a hard filesystem split per repo, offer it: set `env.MONET_STORAGE_DIR` to a per-project path (e.g. `<repo>/.monet`) in the MCP config block you write for them. Default to the shared global store unless they ask.

Merge into the host's **user-level** MCP config **without clobbering existing servers** — read it, add `monet`, write it back, and back up the file first. Verify it comes up: `monet start` logs `semantic embeddings ready (MiniLM, 384-dim)` then `Monet started`, and also prints the active project circle (`Circle: <name>`), confirming per-project organization. The server exposes 14 tools: `agent_context`, `memory_store`, `memory_search`, `memory_overview`, `memory_gather`, `memory_fetch`, `memory_synthesize`, `memory_checkpoint`, `memory_flag_contradiction`, `memory_resolve`, `memory_list`, `memory_reassign_circle`, `memory_detach`, `memory_circle_manage`. Recall is store-wide, with each result card carrying its home circle, so reorganizing circles never breaks findability. `memory_detach` splits observations out of a concept for wrong-merge repair — or, given `destConceptId`, folds them into another concept; detaching all observations with `destConceptId` consolidates the source away, carrying its identity as an alias on the keeper so references keep resolving. `memory_fetch` returns observation entries as `{id, content}`, pages with `observationsOffset`, and includes `lastConfirmedAt` (Unix ms of last evidence-based confirmation) as the staleness signal. `memory_store` accepts `resolution: "forceNew"`/`attachTo` for bulk import and directed attach. `memory_overview` surfaces `possibleDuplicates`. `memory_resolve` handles two verdict families: contradiction resolution (retrying an already-closed contradiction returns `alreadyClosed: true` with zero mutations) and duplicate-pair dismissal (pass `conceptAId` + `conceptBId` to assert two concepts are not duplicates, clearing the pair from `possibleDuplicates`; idempotent when no live edge exists). `memory_circle_manage` handles circle lifecycle — rename/merge/archive with stable aliases (the interactive curation ritual lives in [`curate-memory.md`](curate-memory.md)); `memory_reassign_circle` accepts `ids` batching and `resolution: "auto"|"forceNew"`. The consolidation flow uses `memory_list` and `memory_reassign_circle` (see [`consolidate-memory.md`](consolidate-memory.md)). The server also provides an in-band session lifecycle with zero host configuration: on the first successful tool response, it appends a delimited block (`=== MONET SESSION CONTEXT (auto-prewarm) ===`) as an additional content item carrying active workstreams, top concepts, and a curation advisory — suppressed when the first call is `agent_context` (no double-inject), and opt-out server-side via `MONET_NO_AUTOPREWARM`; after 10 mutating calls (then every 20) it appends a checkpoint nudge, silenced by a checkpoint that saves a workstream; and the server's `instructions` field describes the memory loop so an agent without the Stig persona gets the loop on first use.

## Phase 4 — Install the agent team (user scope)

**Install the full team wherever the host supports it.** Stig is a context engine whose purpose is to orchestrate the workers, so don't drop the workers by *choice* on a host that can run them. Stig is the **lead** (the one the user talks to, the only one that delegates, the only one that touches Monet); the workers are its **subagent actuators**. (On a host that *can't* provide isolated subagents, solo Stig is the honest fallback — see Tier B.)

**Tier A — Lead persona (ask first, highest-impact write).** This is the install's highest-impact write, so it gets its own decision point. Ask: *"Install Stig as the lead persona in your [host's lead-persona location]? This changes how every session on this machine starts."* A general "go ahead with the install" doesn't cover this — wait for an explicit yes (your host's permission system will likely insist on the same). On a no, offer to scope Stig to the current repo's equivalent per-repo location instead (the per-repo option from Phase 1).

Write the body of `agents/stig.md` (wrapped in the `<!-- BEGIN with-monet:stig -->` / `<!-- END with-monet:stig -->` markers) into your host's lead-persona target so the **main agent** acts as Stig and can delegate to workers. A key constraint that must survive regardless of host: the lead is the only agent that delegates and the only one that touches Monet — sub-contexts cannot spawn further sub-contexts, so the lead must be the main agent.

Write it into your host's **always-on lead-persona location** — the file or setting whose content is injected into every session (you know your host's; its docs or the user can confirm). Honor the global-vs-repo scope choice from Phase 1: if the host exposes both a user-scope and a repo-scope location, use the one chosen — never silently switch one for the other.

Wrap the body in idempotent markers so re-running doesn't duplicate it. If the host's lead-persona file requires frontmatter (some hosts' rule files do), put the markers and body **below** that frontmatter — a leading HTML comment can break the file's activation metadata:
```
<!-- BEGIN with-monet:stig -->
…agents/stig.md body…
<!-- END with-monet:stig -->
```
If the markers already exist, replace the block in place; never append a second copy, and never clobber the user's other content in that file (back it up first).

**Tier B — Workers (only where the host has real isolated subagents).** Install the worker team only if your host has a **true named-subagent primitive** — one that gives each worker its *own fresh, isolated context* the lead delegates into, separate from the lead's context and with its own tool access. An always-on "rules"/"instructions" mechanism is **not** this: it bleeds every persona into the main context, breaking the "workers run separately, never touch Monet" invariant. **Feature-detect** this from the host's docs — don't infer it from the host's name. Confirm too that the host's subagents have the tool access each worker needs (file-edit for `developer`/`tester`, web for `researcher`); if they're read-only, tell the user — those workers can't do their job there.

If the host has it: write one worker prompt per worker — `explorer, researcher, analyst, developer, tester, reviewer, auditor, security, reliability, aria` — into the host's subagent location, mapping each worker's `roster.json` fields to the host's format:
- `name` → the host's agent name.
- `description` → the host's dispatch/trigger text — **use it verbatim, not a bare role label**; it's what routes a task to the right worker. (The descriptions contain colons, so quote them if the host's format needs it.)
- `model` → the roster's `haiku`/`sonnet`/`opus` are a **guidance default**; translate them to your host's own model identifiers, or omit to inherit the session model. Offer to retune (cheaper for read-only workers, stronger for `reviewer`/`security`).

Add the `<!-- with-monet:agent -->` marker right after any leading frontmatter — it lets a later memory-consolidation pass tell Monet's installed workers apart from the user's *own* custom sub-contexts, so it never captures or retires the team.

Example worker file (one common format — adapt the frontmatter to your host):
```md
---
name: explorer
description: "Use PROACTIVELY to investigate the codebase: locate files, symbols, call sites, …"
model: haiku
---
<!-- with-monet:agent -->
<body of agents/explorer.md>
```

**If the host has no real isolated subagents: don't fake it.** Installing workers as always-on rules, or telling the lead to role-play them in its own context, breaks the isolation invariant (and hands the lead Monet access while pretending to be a worker). Instead install **Stig solo** — the lead persona + Monet, no worker team — and tell the user delegation isn't available on this host; Stig still runs as a useful memory-augmented single agent. (Or stop, if a lead without its team isn't worth it to them.) Don't claim "manual in-conversation handoff" as an equivalent — it isn't.

**Write each file transparently, one at a time.** Use your host's file-write tool so the user sees every file's content as it's written; never generate a script that batch-writes the agents directory. Host permission systems treat opaque scripted writes to agent config as suspect and will (rightly) block them — per-file writes the user can read are both the polite and the working path.

**Don't clobber.** If the target file already exists, back it up (`<name>.md.bak`) and tell the user before overwriting — generic names (`developer`, `reviewer`, …) can collide with the user's own sub-contexts.

**Reconcile, don't clobber — when a prior install exists with local edits.** Don't blindly overwrite a Stig block or agent file the user has changed. Compare the installed version against the new canonical and merge: keep the user's customizations (extra rules, model choices, tone), apply the new changes. Ensure these invariants survive — and warn the user if one of their edits conflicts with them:
- the Stig block's `<!-- BEGIN with-monet:stig -->` / `<!-- END with-monet:stig -->` markers and each worker's `<!-- with-monet:agent -->` marker (lose them and a later update can't find the block),
- the **Git & PR guardrail**,
- "sub-contexts can't spawn sub-contexts — the lead is the only orchestrator",
- the Monet lifecycle (`agent_context` at start; `memory_store` / `memory_checkpoint`),
- each worker's `name` + `description` — the `description` drives your host's dispatch trigger; if it's broken, delegation silently stops.

Show the merged result, write only on the user's approval, and keep the `.bak`. A coding agent can do this reconciliation by judgment — no version-pinning or 3-way merge tooling required; `.bak` plus approve-before-write keep it safe.

The user may request a trimmed worker set, but the full team is the default on a host that supports it — don't reduce to Stig-only by *choice* (solo Stig is only the fallback for hosts without isolated subagents).

## Phase 5 — Offer the memory-ingest pipeline

Ask: *"Want me to seed Monet from existing knowledge so you don't start empty?"* The richest sources are the ones that already capture how you and your team work:

- **Agent reference files** — `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, Cursor/Cline/Copilot/Windsurf/Continue rules, and any other agent instructions you've written. These often hold the most distilled project knowledge.
- **`README`s and `docs/`** in this repo — architectural decisions, conventions, ADRs.
- **Notes and decision docs** — `NOTES.md`, `TODO`, scratch docs, anything that records *why* decisions were made.
- A path or URL the user names.
- Skip for now.
- (If you're coming from a prior Monet store, say so and I can pull that in too — if it's a *separate* old install with its own MCP server, see the cross-server note in `consolidate-memory.md`.)

For each chosen source: read it, and `memory_store` the durable facts/decisions/patterns (the substrate dedups automatically — store liberally, don't pre-curate). Don't ingest secrets. **Skip Monet's own wiring:** when the source is `CLAUDE.md` (which holds Stig's prompt) or an installed agent prompt, don't store the `<!-- BEGIN with-monet:stig -->…<!-- END with-monet:stig -->` block or any `<!-- with-monet:agent -->`-marked file. Summarize what landed.

Then capture **how you and your team work**, as two distinct kinds:
- **Team ways of working** — conventions, build/test/lint commands, repo layout, norms. Store as project/reference concepts.
- **Personal preferences** — how *you* like the agent to work: voice (e.g. teammate vs. assistant), autonomy, output format. Store as `user` concepts.

Ask directly for the preferences that aren't written down anywhere — especially how you want the agent to *sound*. These get injected into every briefing and applied to how the agent talks to you.

**Existing knowledge to consolidate?** If you find a meaningful pile — agent reference files (`CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`/Cursor/Cline/Copilot/Windsurf rules), a tool-managed memory store, scattered notes/ADRs, or an existing Monet store — don't leave it scattered. Offer the interactive consolidation playbook [`bootstrap/consolidate-memory.md`](consolidate-memory.md) (same raw-URL base as above): capture each source into Monet, organize into per-project circles *with* the user, then retire the source (a pointer or archive) so Monet becomes the single place to read from. This Phase-5 pass ingests but never retires; consolidation does the organize-and-retire, interactively and reversibly. Skip if there's nothing meaningful to consolidate.

## Phase 6 — Offer to start

If your host loads MCP servers and agent prompts only at launch (most do — per Phase 1), tell the user to reload/restart so `monet` connects and the team registers before starting.

Ask: *"Ready? I'll run `agent_context` to restore state and begin as Stig on this project."* On yes: call `agent_context` (no query), report the restored state (active workstreams, living model, open contradictions), and continue as Stig.

## Phase 7 — One last thing (star with-monet)

Once the install is working, ask the user once — lightly, no pressure:

> *"If Monet's earning its keep: I can ⭐ star **team-monet/with-monet** for you (a quick `gh` command you approve), and point you to the one-time setting for new-release notifications. Want either?"*

If they want to **star**, check `gh` is usable (`gh auth status`); if so, run it with their explicit approval:
- **Star (support / bookmark):** `gh api --method PUT /user/starred/team-monet/with-monet`

For **release notifications**, send them to the UI — GitHub's API can't set a release-only watch, so don't automate it: tell them to open the repo and choose **Watch → Custom → Releases**. (Only if they explicitly want notifications for *everything* — issues, PRs, the lot — is the all-activity `gh api --method PUT /repos/team-monet/with-monet/subscription -F subscribed=true` appropriate; never run it under the banner of "release notifications.")

If `gh` is missing or unauthenticated, fall back to the link: open https://github.com/team-monet/with-monet and let them star/watch manually. Ask once; don't nag; never act without a yes.

Key distinction: starring does **not** create notifications — that's what watching is for. Star = support/bookmark; watch = updates (and release-only is a UI choice, not an API one). Keep these separate in how you describe them.

---

## Principles
- **Agent-first:** you do the install; the user converses, approves, and steers.
- **Fix-forward:** on any failure, diagnose and resolve with the user rather than dumping a stack trace.
- **Permission prompts are checkpoints, not failures:** hosts may challenge writes to agent-config locations (the agents dir, global `CLAUDE.md`) because they change how the agent itself behaves. That's expected — pause, show the user what you're about to write and why, and proceed on their explicit OK. Never work around a denial with a script or an indirect write.
- **Customizable:** honor preferences surfaced along the way — global vs per-repo install, storage location, which workers to install and on which models, ingest scope, how much autonomy Stig gets.
- **Non-destructive:** back up before overwriting, merge into existing config rather than replacing it, and never clobber the user's own subagents or `CLAUDE.md`.
